### Hi there üëã

I'm a Python backend developer, actively studying the stack with a focus on **PostgreSQL**, **FastAPI**, and **Django**.  
I write code after designing the architecture of the future application or feature, and I make sure I understand the required stack before using it.
I write all the code myself ‚Äî no AI involved.
